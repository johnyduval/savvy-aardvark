# Savvy Aardvark

This is our final project for [DecodeMTL](https://www.decodemtl.com)

# Why
Many people are allergic to certain foods, and it has become harder and harder to determine
whether or not that nasty ingredient is in the food due to multiple names and pseudonyms, etc.
We hope that the Savvy Aardvark will be your friend and let you know.

## App Description
The Savvy Aardvark will allow users to _know_ whether a certain food is _allowed_
given certain constraints. It will take your food restriction(s), analyze the ingredients
of the food item you requested and will let you know if the ingredient you are watching out
for is in there or not.
